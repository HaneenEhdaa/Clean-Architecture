# Flutter Clean Architecture with Dependency Injection (GetIt)

## Overview

This project follows Clean Architecture principles in Flutter to separate concerns and improve maintainability. It uses GetIt for Dependency Injection (DI), allowing better scalability and testability.The app demonstrates fetching employee data from a remote API using Dio, following a structured approach with Repositories, Use Cases, and Cubits for state management.

## Features
